GitHub repository for www.duncan.net.nz

This is a Drupal based build.
The intention is to incorporate a series of pieces together to create a community that makes better use of the research on how people work together. This includes dealing with ownership, feedback including reimbursement and tragedy of the commons crimes, and group boundaries.

Tasks:
- Establish a Drupal 7 base.
- Add Mollom for spam protection.
- Add Organic Groups for group management.
- Add Organic Groups Clone for group protection, similar to how git repositories fork when people want to take it in a different direction to developers. Will have to explore merging groups later.
- Determine feasibility to getting the reimbursement mechanism out of the git project "Better Means"
- Create an annotation system using book pages that allows content to be nested within nodes that can be displayed side by side.
- Add a reputation system, using Better Means and normal Drupal modules, that shows who added what to nodes, and gives reputation based on reads, likes and shares etc. 

Real world tasks:
- Decide on a name/domain name for the project going forward.
- Establish a Cooperative Company.
- Create the constitution to formalise incentives and disincentives, establish that both employees and customers are both voluntary positions with reimbursement matched to impacts and describe all as peers.
- Establish a Trust setup that gives ownership of all the shares of the company to the company entity itself and does not specify shares per individual, but collective ownership. Selling the company must not produce a benefit for any individual associated with the company or trust so that there is no incentive for damaging the investment of the peers. Establish the company peers as both trustees and beneficiaries.
 

This is a basic write up for the moment but the full version will be done on www.duncan.net.nz and then this will be replaced with a link to that content.
